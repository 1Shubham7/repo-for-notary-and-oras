## OCI - Open Container Initiative
_" The Open Container Initiative (OCI) is a lightweight, open governance structure (project), formed under the auspices of the Linux Foundation, for the express purpose of creating open industry standards around container formats and runtimes. "_
The OCI provides a set of open standards and specifications for containers. These standards ensure that containers created by different tools and platforms work together smoothly

The OCI currently contains three specifications: 
1. the Runtime Specification (runtime-spec)
   This specification explains how to run a container. It defines the setup and environment for a container to work properly.
   
2. the Image Specification (image-spec)
   This specification describes how to create a container image.
  
3. Distribution Specification (distribution-spec).
   This specification outlines how container images should be stored and shared. It defines the rules for uploading and downloading container images to and from
   container registries.
