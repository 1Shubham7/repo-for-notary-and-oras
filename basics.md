We all know what containers are, let's directly jump into Container Registries and OCI

## Container Registries -
Container registries are centralized repositories that store and manage container images. In the context of software development and deployment using containers,a container registry plays a crucial role in 
facilitating the storage, distribution, and versioning of container images.

Like Docker Hub, it is a container registry
Now like every cloud service like Google has container registry called Google Container Registry (GCR), Amazon has Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), so keep that in mind.
