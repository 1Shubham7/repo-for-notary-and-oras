## OCI - Open Container Initiative
_The Open Container Initiative is an open governance structure for the express purpose of creating open industry standards around container formats and runtimes._
The OCI provides a set of open standards and specifications for these containers, just like a standard box size and packaging guidelines. These standards ensure
that containers created by different tools and platforms work together smoothly
